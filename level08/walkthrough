decompile ./level08

the program tries to open 3 files: 
 - ./backups/.log
 - av[1]
 - ./backups/av[1] in Exclusive mode (fail to open if file already exist)

 our solution is to: 
 - cd to /tmp
 - create a backups directory in tmp to have full rights in it
 - create a .log file in it
 - create /tmp/backups/home/users/level09/
 - make it so that when we pass it as av[1] : /home/users/level09/.pass
 - the av[1] open will open the .pass

and the ./backups/av[1] will open a new file in /tmp/backups/home/users/level09/.pass
and put the password there
