decompile ./level04
they tell us to input shellcode
they use ptrace to make sure that we don't use execve in our shellcode
we can directly call the library system function, get address via gdb, just need something after
in the next 4 bytes to fill the return address of system, and last 4 bytes being the
address of '/bin/sh' inside the program.
p system in gdb to find the adress of system
info proc map and then find in libc adresses /bin/sh to find the adress of /bin/sh
SHELLCODE = `python -c 'import struct; print "a" * 156 + struct.pack("<I", ADDRESS system() ) +"a" *4 + struct.pack("<I", ADDRESS /bin/sh)'`
