decompile ./level03

the important part is the decrypt function
it used a xor on a saved string against a char 
and if a the result match "Congratulations!", it execute system("/bin/sh")

the char is the result of 322424845 - scanf("%d", input)
but the test function will only send a nonrandom  char if the result is between 1 and 21 included
we can either brute force each number so that 322424845 - input is between 1 and 21
or we can check wich number when xor'ed with the encryption key string result in Congratulations!
either way the number is 18 so the input should be 322424845 - 18 = 322424827
